# MazeSolverCV
An OpenCV project to detect mazes and solve them using Dijistra's algorithm in real-time

Uses Tensorflow's Object Detection API to detect a maze then proceeds to use OpenCV to superimpose the correct shortest path between the start and end using Dijistra's algorithm.


#### Current State of the Project:

- [x] Added Object Detection of Mazes
- [ ] Solving the maze using Dijistra's algorithm 
- [ ] Superimposing the solved path on original feed

Open to any new ideas!
